# Threads scraper

This threads scraper is derived from the threads web scraper by Scrapfly (https://scrapfly.io/blog/how-to-scrape-threads/). I am still working on it but it already produces usable sample data. Note, that requests only fetch the last 26 posts or so from a profile. The jupyter notebook in this repo can be used for further analysis. Until now it only loads data into a dataframe (pandas). For more info go to ScrapFlys github (https://github.com/scrapfly/scrapfly-scrapers/tree/main/threads-scraper).
